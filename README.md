# TF-Keras: the pure-TensorFlow implementation of Keras

This repository hosts the development of the TF-Keras library. It is a pure
TensorFlow implementation of Keras, based on the legacy `tf.keras` codebase.

Note that the "main" version of Keras is now Keras 3 (formerly Keras Core),
which is a multi-backend implementation of Keras, supporting JAX,
PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Keras 3 is being developed at
[keras-team/keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras).
