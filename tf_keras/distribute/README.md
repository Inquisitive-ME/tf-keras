# TF-Keras with Distribution Strategy Tests

This directory contains unit tests that combine TF-Keras library with
[Distribution Training](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/distributed_training).
Tests that use a custom training loop instead of TF-Keras compile/fit should be
placed under python/distribute directory instead.
